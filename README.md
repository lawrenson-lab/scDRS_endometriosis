Code used for the manuscript ***M2 macrophages are major mediators of germline risk of endometriosis and explain pleiotropy with comorbid traits***

Application of the single cell disease relevance score on the endometriosis atlas allows us to identify associations between the inherited component of endometriosis risk and M2 macrophages, dendritic cells and endothelial cells. Expression of interleukin 1A and 1B transcripts correlated with the scDRS, nominating these molecules as mediators of risk. Treatment of assembloids that mimic human endometrial tissues resulted in a critical alteration in cellular morphology. Treatment with an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist diminished endometriosis-associated pain in an in vivo model
